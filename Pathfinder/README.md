# JavaFX Maze Game with A* Pathfinding

This is a simple JavaFX-based application that features a maze-like grid with a player and a chaser.
The chaser uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to chase the player through the maze.
The player can move within the grid, while the chaser intelligently pursues them, navigating around obstacles using A*.

## Features
- A grid-based maze layout
- A player that can be controlled using the arrow keys
- A chaser that uses (currently) A* algorithm to chase the player
- Obstacles like walls that limit the players movements
- Obstacles like Sand and Snow tiles to slow down both the player and the chaser
